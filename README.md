# Project 2: Expense Tracking

The general idea is a budget tracking platform that will allow the user to categorise their spendings and gain insight into how they spend money.

The user will be able to have a fully customisable dashboard, where they can select a category, create an expense based on projected and actual spendings thus allowing better control of cashflow.

Further development will include adding interactive reports, visual representations of data and a more user friendly and mobile agnostic design.
